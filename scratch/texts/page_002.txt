Section One
This is the first section of the document. It has some more placeholder text to show how 
the document looks like. The text is not meant to be meaningful or informative, but rather to 
demonstrate the layout and formatting of the document.
• This is the first bullet point
• This is the second bullet point
• This is the third bullet point
Section Two
This is the second section of the document. It is more of the same as we’ve seen in the rest 
of the document. The content is meaningless, but the intent is to create a very simple 
smoke test to ensure extraction is working as intended. This will be used in CI as time goes 
on to ensure that changes we make to the library do not negatively impact our accuracy.
